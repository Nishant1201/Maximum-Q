Max-Q is the point in the launch sequence where the rocket experiences the maximum dynamic pressure.

Buckle up, this is where it gets technical.

The rocket, as it is going up into space, is experiencing three forces: gravity (down), thrust (up), and atmospheric drag (down).

The rocket starts to accelerate and the drag force starts to grow dramatically, since the force is related to velocity squared: whenever the speed doubles, the force quadruples. 
But, at the same time, the air density is decreasing, so the force is weakening because of this. At some altitude, the decreasing air density wins 
out over the increasing velocity, and the drag force starts to decrease.

It is this point â€“ where the increasing velocity is balanced by the decreasing density of the atmosphere and the drag force starts to decrease that is called Max-Q.
